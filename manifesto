things all DAWs do badly
1. GUIs look like bill gates on a bad day
        grey boxes with color accents
        design should have a personality
2. idioms just copy 70's studio workflows
        hardware emulation is great but it's already been perfected
        needs to feel intuitive and fun to use
        intro users should be able to do basic stuff quickly
        and pro users should be able to get under the hood and do real work
3. too proprietary, bloated
        can't collaborate with people in different environments and platforms
        no low spec support despite no useful new features since the 90's
4. not modular
        a voice over actor doesn't need virtual instruments
        a bedroom producer doesn't need a billion routing options
        needs to be able to turn on and off modules at runtime and / or install
5. inadequate midi implementation
        midi is simple. midi is life. it's just ints.
        humanization is always a hack. it's easy to do. should be built in.
        converting audio to midi values is hard but there must be a better way
        randomization / algorithmic generation based on seed inputs built in
6. no CLI mode / batch processing
        weird electronic artists want it, AI researchers need it
7. no TUI mode
        nobody wants this except nathan but he wants it a lot
8. audio vs midi tracks
        bifurcation is a legacy of 80s workflows. it's confusing and unnecessary.
        an audio track is just a midi track with one note that plays for a long time
        alternate takes of audio should just be different midi notes
