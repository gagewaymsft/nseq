To create a high-performance DAW that can run on low-powered devices, you should focus on efficient architecture and design patterns. Here are some suggestions:

Modular architecture: Break your DAW into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and optimized individually. This approach allows for better maintainability and scalability of your project. Some potential modules could be audio engine, MIDI engine, plugin manager, user interface, and file handling.
Component-based design: Implement a component-based design, where each module consists of reusable components. This allows you to build new features by reusing existing components and reduces overall code complexity.
Single Responsibility Principle: Each component and module should have a single responsibility. This principle makes it easier to optimize individual components and improves code readability and maintainability.
Data-Oriented Design (DOD): Focus on the efficient organization and processing of data, rather than the structure of the code. DOD reduces cache misses and results in better performance, especially on low-powered devices. This approach is particularly relevant for audio and MIDI data processing.
Object pooling: Reuse objects instead of creating and destroying them frequently. Object pooling can help reduce memory fragmentation and improve performance by minimizing memory allocations and deallocations.
Real-time processing: Separate the real-time audio processing thread from the user interface and other non-critical tasks. This ensures that audio processing is uninterrupted, even when the UI or other tasks require significant resources.
Multithreading: Take advantage of multithreading for computationally intensive tasks, such as audio processing or plugin hosting. Ensure that shared resources are protected using appropriate synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, or lock-free data structures.
Optimized data structures and algorithms: Choose efficient data structures and algorithms for critical operations, such as audio and MIDI processing. Profile your code to identify bottlenecks and optimize them accordingly.
Lazy evaluation: Use lazy evaluation techniques, where calculations are deferred until their results are required. This can help save processing power by not performing unnecessary calculations.
SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations: Take advantage of SIMD instructions, available in modern processors, to perform the same operation on multiple data elements simultaneously. This can significantly improve the performance of audio processing algorithms.
Cross-platform and platform-specific optimizations: Ensure your code is cross-platform compatible, and take advantage of platform-specific optimizations where appropriate.
